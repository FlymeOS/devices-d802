There's a simple and a complex syntax to declare the availability of a
media codec:

A codec that properly follows the OpenMax spec and therefore doesn't have any
quirks and that only supports a single content type can be declared like so:

    <MediaPlayer name="OMX.foo.bar" type="something/interesting" />

If a codec has quirks OR supports multiple content types, the following syntax
can be used:

    <MediaPlayer name="OMX.foo.bar" >
        <Type name="something/interesting" />
        <Type name="something/else" />
        ...
        <Quirk name="requires-allocate-on-input-ports" />
        <Quirk name="requires-allocate-on-output-ports" />
        <Quirk name="output-buffers-are-unreadable" />
    </MediaPlayer>

Only the three quirks included above are recognized at this point:

"requires-allocate-on-input-ports"
    must be advertised if the component does not properly support specification
    of input buffers using the OMX_UseBuffer(...) API but instead requires
    OMX_AllocateBuffer to be used.

"requires-allocate-on-output-ports"
    must be advertised if the component does not properly support specification
    of output buffers using the OMX_UseBuffer(...) API but instead requires
    OMX_AllocateBuffer to be used.

"output-buffers-are-unreadable"
    must be advertised if the emitted output buffers of a decoder component
    are not readable, i.e. use a custom format even though abusing one of
    the official OMX colorspace constants.
    Clients of such Local will not be able to access the decoded data,
    naturally making the component much less useful. The only use for
    a component with this quirk is to render the output to the screen.
    Audio Local MUST NOT advertise this quirk.
    Video Local that advertise this quirk must be accompanied by a
    corresponding color space converter for thumbnail extraction,
    matching surfaceflinger support that can render the custom format to
    a texture and possibly other code, so just DON'T USE THIS QUIRK.
